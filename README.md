# Fractio
Tools for fractional differentiation of time series.
Based on mathematical procedures and code found in:

Marcos Lopez de Prado. 2018. Advances in Financial Machine Learning (1st. ed.). Wiley Publishing.

This implementation simplifies the use of datetime-indexed time series at the cost of computation speed.

Work in progress.
